As I get introduced to applied machine learning the gaps in my math education become clear.  Theoretically one should be able to describe the various machine learning processes mathematically.  I doubt that would be within my grasp buyt I would like to get a better grasp pf the concepts behind some of these major math systems . I will update this document as I commit more resources.  Essentially one nees to have an understanding of Calculus 2 and Linear Algebra.  Though I basiclly use Sci Kit library for Python which does much of the heavy lifting including troubleshooting it is clearly very important for one to have more of a mathematical understanding of what is going on if they really want to push the envelope in this field or at least ensure that logical choices are being made .  

I will categorize the elements here as I update and understand the field more. I hope to make this a useful repository where I can easily list what is in there so that people either move along or find that they have a realy need for some if what I am putting up here.  Suggestions or requests would be greatly appreciated
